CS PhD student at Singapore Management University

I am a first-year PhD student in the Software Analytics Research (SOAR) group at the Singapore Management University (SMU), fortunate to be advised by Prof. David Lo. Before starting my PhD, I completed my Bachelor's degree at Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), where I was mentored by Prof. Yuqun Zhang. I have also worked as a research intern under Prof. Umang Mathur at the National University of Singapore (NUS).
